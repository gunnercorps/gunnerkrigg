##How to set up the tagging helper

The tagging helper will work out of the box- just open "index.htm" if you want to work on already tagged pages, or "index2.htm" if you also want to work on untagged pages.
Ideally, install Python 2.x.x (current production version 2.7.5) (available at http://www.python.org/getit/); then whenever you want to update index.htm or index2.htm with the latest information on the GitHub, just run "tagged.py" or "othertagged.py" respectively.
Please give feedback!
Good luck!
