##How to set up the tagging helper

The tagging helper will work out of the box- just open "taghelper.htm".

Ideally, install Python 2.x.x (current production version 2.7.5) (available at http://www.python.org/getit/); then whenever you want to update it with your latest index.txt, just run "taghelper.py".

Please give feedback!
Good luck!
