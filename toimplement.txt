##To implement

###Main Website

- "Spoiler" tag for tag list
- Categorisation of types of tags (characters vs symbols vs ideas vs settings vs plots)
- Links to wiki as relevant(?)
- Tag counts
- Ability to select more than one tag at once? (Kat AND Paz for example)

###Index

###Alltags

- Categorisation of types of tags
- Rationalise tags and de-duplicate (ongoing task)

###Tag Helper

- tags that when hovered over will show the definition
- clickable tags that generate a string for insertion into index.txt
- "save" button to generate a temporary file (or possibly even insert into index.txt?)
